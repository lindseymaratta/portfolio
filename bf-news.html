<h3 class="xs-mb1">Goal</h3>
<p class="xs-mb2">During a recent push for brand awareness, we were tasked with a refresh of the BuzzFeed News homepage. We needed to transfer our news front page onto our new technical stack, allowing us to introduce responsive design with some specialized News components. We also were to incorporate a new "Reporting To You" tagline timed with a special brand activation.</p>
<p class="xs-mb2">For the creation of the BuzzFeed News Investigations page, our goal was to provide a destination for the hard-hitting journalism that our investigations teams was doing around the globe. The page would help build credibility, especially to encourage and support whistle blowers who had  tips to share with the team. It is attached to email signatures, shared on social, and promoted through our on-site news channels.<p>
