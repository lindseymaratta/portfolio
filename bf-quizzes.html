<span class="bold caps xs-text-5 xs-mb1">Context</span>
<p class="xs-mb2">Quizzes are perhaps the BuzzFeedâ€™s most well loved and well known product. Incrementally, in various roles, I led the design effort to improve the experience of bothmaking and taking a BuzzFeed quiz. As a product designer for our proprietary CMS, I overhauled our legacy quiz maker. This resulted in an ~30% in quiz production across both editorial and community contributors, x% increase in translated quizzes internationally, as well as an improved consumer experience through smart defaults and careful considerations for mobile. After moving onto our Site Experience team, I continued the renovation by refining the experience of taking a quiz on our website, informed by pain points discovered in quick and scrappy user observation sessions. Lastly, given the drastic increase in quiz output by our community contributors, I advocated for and led a product discovery project to define the investment in the next generation of tech to support our enthusiastic community users.<p>

<span class="bold caps xs-text-5 xs-mb1">Problems</span>
<p class="xs-mb2">Quiz answer tiles were actually images, created painstakingly in photoshop by editors and community creators alike. They were inaccessible by screen readers and SEO. They were also impossible to translate without recreating the quiz from scratch, and difficult to edit retroactively by staff who made a mistake or wanted to correct a community-contributed quiz. In conducting some guerilla user research, we uncovered several UX painpoints on the consumer side. On the organizational front, my research also uncovered that our community team and their contributions were vastly underestimated and neglected.<p>

<span class="bold caps xs-text-5 xs-mb1">Goals</span>
<p class="xs-mb2">We wanted to be able to promote more community quizzes, make strings available for easy translation, and reduce time requirement for quizmakers. We also were looking to improve and update the consumer quiz experience to be up to par with the rest of the site and apps, and alleviate some UX painpoints. For Community, I wanted to quantify the value and opportunity behind community-generated quizzes, educate the organization about their value, and propose a path forward.<p>

	<span class="bold caps xs-text-5 xs-mb1">Results</span>
<p class="xs-mb2">Promoted quizzes from the community overlook editorially created quizzes, and community-generated content rocketed to 1/2 of all quiz traffic. Mobile web quizzes look and feel more similar to the experience in our native apps, and recorded shares rose by 3%. By setting some thoughtful defaults in the quizmaker tool itself, we saw writers more frequently lay out their quizzes with mobile in mind where they hadn't done so previously. Additionally, in part due to the work outline above, an and-to-end quiz team was formed within the organization, included in its mission to support the long-neglected community team and their contributions.<p>
