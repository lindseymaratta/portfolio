<span class="bold caps xs-text-5 xs-mb1">Context</span>
<p class="xs-mb2">Quizzes are perhaps the BuzzFeed’s most well loved and well known product. Incrementally, in various roles, I led the design effort to improve the experience of bothmaking and taking a BuzzFeed Quiz. As a product designer for our proprietary CMS, I overhauled our legacy quiz maker. This resulted in an x% in quiz production across both editorial and community contributors, x% increase in translated quizzes internationally, as well as an improved consumer experience through smart defaults and careful considerations for mobile. After moving onto our Site Experience team, I continued the renovation by refining the experience of taking a quiz on our website, informed by pain points discovered in quick and scrappy user observation sessions. Lastly, given the drastic increase in quiz output by our community contributors, I advocated for and led a product discovery project to define the investment in the next generation of tech to support our enthusiastic community users.<p>

<span class="bold caps xs-text-5 xs-mb1">Problems</span>
<p class="xs-mb2">Quiz tiles were actually images, created painstakingly in photoshop by editors and community creators alike. They were inaccessible by screen readers and SEO. Impossible to translate without recreating the quiz from scratch. Difficult to edit retroactively, by staff who made their mistakes or wanted to correct a community-contributed quiz. In conducting some guerilla user research, we uncovered several UX painpoints on the consumer side. On the organizational front, I uncovered that our community team and contributions were vastly underestimated and neglected.<p>

<span class="bold caps xs-text-5 xs-mb1">Goals</span>
<p class="xs-mb2">Promote more community quizzes, make string available for easy translation, reduce time requirement for editorial. Improve and update the consumer quiz experience to be up to par with the rest of the site and alleviate UX painpoints. For Community, quantify the value and opportunity behind community-generated quizzes, educate the organization and propose a path forward.<p>

	<span class="bold caps xs-text-5 xs-mb1">Results</span>
<p class="xs-mb2">Promoted quizzes from the community overlook editorially created quizzes, and community-generated content rocketed to 1/2 of all quiz traffic. Translated quizzes great. Mobile quizzes look better. By setting a default state of 2up-style quizzes we were able to move users to think about mobile where that hadn’t previously. A quiz team was formed within the organization, with part of its mission to support the long-neglected community team and their contributions.<p>
