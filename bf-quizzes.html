<h3>Context</h3>
<p class="xs-mb2">Quizzes are perhaps the BuzzFeedâ€™s most recognizable consumer product. Incrementally, in various roles, I led the design effort to improve the experience of both making and taking a BuzzFeed quiz. As a product designer for our proprietary CMS, I overhauled our legacy quiz maker. After moving to a consumer products team, I continued the renovation by refining the experience of taking a quiz on our website, informed by pain points discovered in user observation sessions. Having recognized significant quiz output coming from our community contributors, I advocated for and led a product discovery project to define the investment in the next generation of tech to support our enthusiastic community users. In another role, I designed an "infinite" quiz experience across web, iOS, and Android.<p>

<h3 class="xs-mb1">Problems</h3>
<p class="xs-mb2">In our legacy quiz maker, each answer tile was an image, created painstakingly in photoshop by editors and community creators alike. They were inaccessible by screen readers and bad for SEO. They were also impossible to translate without recreating the quiz from scratch, and difficult to edit retroactively by staff who made a mistake or wanted to correct a community-contributed quiz. In conducting some guerilla user research, we also uncovered several UX painpoints on the consumer side. On the organizational front, my research also uncovered that our community team and their contributions were underestimated, and neglected from a technical standpoint.<p>

<h3 class="xs-mb1">Goals</h3>
<p class="xs-mb2">On the tooling side, we wanted to be able to promote more community quizzes, make strings available for easy translation, and reduce time requirement for quizmakers. We also were looking to improve and update the consumer quiz experience to be up to par with the rest of our site and apps, while alleviating some UX painpoints. For our "infinite quiz" project, we saw an opportunity for recirculating our highly engaged quiz users, and we set out to create a seamless transition from one quiz to the next. Lastly, for Community, we were hoping to quantify the value and opportunity behind community-generated quizzes, educate the organization about their value, and propose a path forward.<p>

<h3 class="xs-mb1">Results</h3>
<p class="xs-mb2">Our quizmaker tool redesign resulted in an ~30% increase in quiz production across both editorial and community contributors, along with a significant increase in translated quizzes internationally. Promoted quizzes from the community overtook editorially created quizzes, and traffic to community-generated content rocketed to 1/2 of all quiz traffic. Mobile web quizzes now look and feel more similar to the experience in our native apps, and recorded shares rose by 3% due to the consumer products overhaul. By setting some thoughtful defaults in the quizmaker tool, we saw writers more frequently lay out their quizzes with mobile in mind where they hadn't done so previously. Our "infinite quiz" efforts resulted in a ~10% increase in quiz views. Additionally, in part due to the work outlined above, an and-to-end quiz team was formed within the organization, and included in its mission was supporting the long-neglected community team.</p>
