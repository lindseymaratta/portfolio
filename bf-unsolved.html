<h3 class="xs-mb1">Problem</h3>
<p class="xs-mb2">BuzzFeed Unsolved, one of BuzzFeed’s first long-form video productions, consistently draws a huge (2M views per episode) and highly engaged audience. However, there was no experience on buzzfeed.com tailored for watching longer-from video content, and more shows like this were in the production pipeline.  Additionally, growing and supporting this audience on site could unlock significant revenue opportunities in the form of sponsorships and advertising. So, our small team of ten set off on a month-long experiment to determine the potential to move or scale this audience on buzzfeed.com.<p>

<h3 class="xs-mb1">Goal</h3>
<p class="xs-mb2">Create a compelling user experience on buzzfeed.com for our most engaged fans of longer form content. Our MVP would address one show in particular - Unsolved. We were to provide a content-specific experience while considering opportunities to scale to other shows. Our long term goal would be to get users to choose our unique experience on  BF.com for the first viewing of Unsolved episodes and increase video views on-site.<p>

<h3 class="xs-mb1">Define</h3>
<p class="xs-mb2">We discussed business opportunities with internal partners in production and business, and conducted remote user interviews to understand existing user behavior and needs. We also defined our timeline - we had only one month to ship the product alongside a season launch for the show.</p>

<h3 class="xs-mb1">Explore</h3>
<p class="xs-mb2">We conducted a 4-day design sprint with stakeholders in LA. We adapted Google Ventures format for our stakeholder needs and timeline, focusing on the question, “Will a differentiated experience on Buzzfeeed.com move user behavior towards watching Unsolved episodes O&O?”. We generated ideas through a Crazy 8s exercise, evaluated though voting and critique, and refined our explorations into a storyboard as a guide for prototyping. Our core team of three then spent one day building a comprehensive keynote prototype featuring five concepts of varying complexity. We recruited and tested with users the following day. We were surprised to learn that some of our lowest-investment ideas were the ones that resonated most with users.

<h3 class="xs-mb1">Refine</h3>
<p class="xs-mb2">We scoped our MVP to include a base video watching experience with the addition of one content-specific feature that showed the most promise in user testing – research notes.  We began exploring layouts for basic page functionality, refined based on feedback from the team and stakeholders, and informed by technical and time constraints.</p>

<h3 class="xs-mb1">Build</h3>
<p class="xs-mb2">With a launch deadline rapidly approaching, I created a simple paper prototype to demonstrate the behavior of a video carousel, tested it on colocated colleagues, and shared it with developers and QA engineers through a narrated video spec.  I worked alongside developers, in and out of the codebase, to refine visual design and complex user flows. With limited staffing, I also worked with the show research team to visually refine the format the notes themselves for inclusion on the page.</p>

<h3 class="xs-mb1">Ship</h3>
<p>We successfully launched on our target deadline, just 30 days after finishing our design sprint. We followed up immediately with a narrowed UX research study, focusing on usability. We then iterated on the base UX and visual hierarchy of the page based on pain points discovered in testing. Initial quantitative analysis pointed to promising video engagement and completion rate of research notes, as well as generating plenty of enthusiasm on social. The project stands to inform the future of BuzzFeed's understanding and approach to long form video conusmption.</p>
