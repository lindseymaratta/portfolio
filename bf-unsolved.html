<span class="bold caps xs-text-5 xs-mb1">Problem</span>
<p class="xs-mb2">BuzzFeed Unsolved , one of BuzzFeed’s first long-form shows The show draws a huge (2M views per episode) and highly engaged audience. However, there was no experience on buzzfeed.com tailored for watching longer-from video content, and more shows like this were in the production pipeline.  Additionally, growing and supporting the audience of these shows on our owned and operated web property could unlock significant revenue opportunities in the form of sponsorships and advertising. So, our small team of ten set off on a month-long experiment to determine whether or not we could move or scale this audience on buzzfeed.com.<p>

<span class="bold caps xs-text-5 xs-mb1">Goal</span>
<p class="xs-mb2">Create a compelling user experience on buzzfeed.com for our most engaged fans of longer form content. Our MVP case would address one show in particular - Unsolved. Provide content-specific experiences while considering opportunities to scale to other shows. Our long term goal would be to get users to choose our unique experience on  BF.com for the first viewing of Unsolved episodes and increase video view on-site.<p>

<span class="bold caps xs-text-5 xs-mb1">Define</span>
<p class="xs-mb2">We discussed business opportunities with internal partners in production and business, and conducted remote user interviews to understand existing user behavior and needs. We also defined our timeline - we had only one month to launch a product alongside a season launch for the show.</p>

<span class="bold caps xs-text-5 xs-mb1">Explore</span>
<p class="xs-mb2">We conducted a 4-day design sprint with stakeholders in LA. We adapted Google Ventures format for our stakeholder needs and timeline, focusing on the question “Will a differentiated experience on Buzzfeeed.com move user behavior towards watching Unsolved episodes O&O?”. We generated ideas through Crazy 8s exercise, evaluated though voting and critique, and refined our explorations into a storyboard as a guide for prototyping. Our core team of three than built a comprehensive keynote prototype with five concepts of varying difficulty in one day. We then recruited and tested with users at the end of the sprint. We were surprised to learn that some of our lowest-investment ideas were the ones that resonated most with users.

<span class="bold caps xs-text-5 xs-mb1">Refine</span>
<p class="xs-mb2">We scoped our MVP to include a base video watching experience with the addition of the single differentiating feature that showed the most promise in user testing – research notes.  We began exploring layouts for basic page functionality, refined based on feedback from the team and stakeholders, and informed by technical and time constraints.</p>

<span class="bold caps xs-text-5 xs-mb1">Build</span>
<p class="xs-mb2">With the short timeline available to us, I created a simple paper prototype to explain video carousel behavior, tested it on colocated colleagues, and shared it with developers and QA engineers through a narrated video spec.  I worked alongside developers, in and out of the codebase, to refine visual design and complex user flows. With limited staffing, I also worked with the show research team to visually refine the format the notes themselves for inclusion on the page.</p>

<p>We successfully launched on our target deadline, just 30 days after finishing our design sprint. I followed up immediately with a narrowed UX research study, focusing on usability while continuing to gain insight into desirability of differentiating features like research notes and basic video player behavior. We iterated on base UX and visual hierarchy of the page based on pain points discovered in testing.</p>

<span class="bold caps xs-text-5 xs-mb1">Results + Next Steps</span>
<p class="xs-mb2">Initial quantitative analysis points to high engagement (50% of visitors) and completion rate of research notes (25%), despite initially minimal traffic driven to the experience. Next steps are gradually ramp up acquisition levers while a/b testing new features and retention strategies.</p>
